To execute my Iris classification program using perceptrons, download "perceptron.py" file and run the program in an appropriate IDE. Results will be printed.
To execute the tool-based program using a python library, download “toolPerceptron.py” and run the program in an appropriate IDE.
"train.txt" is used to train each perceptron to classify whether a flower belongs to one specie or not.
“test.txt” is used to test each perceptron’s accuracy in classification of Iris flowers.
“out.txt” is an output file showing the actual classification vs the perceptron’s classification.
“Comparison.txt” is a file comparing the recall and precision of my program to a tool-based program using python’s panda library.
